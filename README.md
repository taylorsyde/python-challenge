# Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie

## PyBank

![Revenue](Images/revenue-per-lead.png)

In this challenge, I analyzed the financial records of my 'very real' company. This program returns ...

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average monthly change in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


## PyPoll

![Vote Counting](Images/Vote_counting.png)

In this challenge, I was contracted by UFP to help a 'very real' small, rural civilization modernize its vote counting process. This program returns...

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

This program can quickly be changed to account for new elections and candidates. However, it is limited it that it cannot tally votes for candidates that have been written in. UFP is working on revisions to this code under the supervision of Lt. Uhura of the USS Enterprise.
